### Java function to export data:
* Exporting data from Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to Amazon S3 in Java involves several steps
* This is the example using the Jedis library for Redis interactions and the AWS SDK for Java to work with S3
* This example uses Maven for dependency management.

### Deployment the Java tool to a managed cloud environment using Terraform:
* This example assumes you are deploying to AWS using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Update the region and other values according to your AWS environment

### Terraform commands for deployment
* Run the following commands in your terminal to deploy the application:
  ```sh
  terraform init
  ```

  ```sh
  terraform apply
  ```
  Confirm the deployment by entering "yes" when prompted
* Package your Java application into a JAR file and deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This can be done manually through the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI. Ensure your Java tool JAR file is ready for deployment.

### Note: 
* Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials before running Terraform commands.
